            <div class="salutation">Dear NeuraTech Labs Team,</div>

            <div class="body-content">
                <p>I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the AI Engineer position at NeuraTech Labs. Your mission to build cutting-edge, scalable AI systems that create real-world impact directly aligns with my professional experience and passion. With a Master's in Artificial Intelligence and a proven track record of designing and deploying models in production, I am confident that I have the skills required to contribute to your team.</p>
<p>In my current role as an AI Engineer at DeepMetric Labs, I have been responsible for the end-to-end lifecycle of machine learning systems. I spearheaded the deployment of our ML pipelines using MLflow and Docker across a distributed AWS infrastructure, which was critical for streamlining our CI/CD and testing processes. This experience in MLOps and building for scalability would allow me to directly contribute to your goal of developing robust, production-ready systems.</p>
<p>The job descriptionâ€™s emphasis on NLP and generative AI is particularly exciting. I have hands-on experience in this area, having recently developed PromptTutor, a tool that uses LangChain and the OpenAI API to help users refine generative prompts. Furthermore, during my time as a Machine Learning Researcher, I developed a custom transformer-based architecture for text summarization, which improved ROUGE scores by 17% and resulted in a publication at ACL.</p>
<p>My background also extends to computer vision, where I designed FaceGuard, a deepfake detection tool using an EfficientNet and LSTM architecture that achieved 94% accuracy. I am proficient in Python and frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and my project work has given me a solid foundation for building and fine-tuning models across various domains. I am eager to apply this diverse skill set to the challenges at NeuraTech Labs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="closing">Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences can benefit NeuraTech Labs.</div>
