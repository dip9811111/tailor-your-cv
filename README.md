# 🎯 tailor-your-CV: AI-Powered Job-Tailored Resume Generator

tailor-your-CV is a powerful tool that helps users craft customized, high-impact resumes based on job descriptions using
either Google Gemini 2.5 Pro or OpenAI GPT-4.1. Simply upload your professional experience, paste a job description,
and let the LLM generate a tailored curriculum vitae aligned with your target role — all based on your chosen template.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 **Experience Upload**: Upload a file containing:
    - Work experience
    - Additional personal or freelance projects
    - Hard & soft skills
    - Academic achievements
    - Personal information (mail, phone, LinkedIn profile, etc.)

  > ✅ *Tip: A simple file format (like a plain `.txt` file) with all the details is preferred—avoid complex or heavily
  structured formats.*


- 🖋️ **Markdown Conversion**: Uses `MarkItDown` to convert your uploaded file to clean Markdown, which is then injected
  into the LLM for optimized processing.

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Tailoring**: Paste a job description and automatically generate a resume tailored to match it, using
  Gemini 2.5 Pro or GPT-4.1's advanced understanding of language and relevance.

- 🎨 **Template-Based Output**: Resumes are created using an HTML template and converted to PDF. You can choose from
  multiple professionally designed templates to match your style and industry.

- ✏️ **Live Editing & Preview**: You can now **modify the AI-generated resume**—add, edit, or remove any section—and *
  *see a live preview** before downloading the final PDF.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Document Ingestion**: The user's resume or experience file is processed and converted into clean Markdown — a
   structured, LLM-friendly format. Once completed, two files are generated: `structured_cv.pkl` (a serialized
   structured representation) and `user_curriculum.md` (the Markdown version). These are cached for future use, so this
   step can be skipped on subsequent runs unless the input document changes.

2. **Structured CV Generation**: Leveraging the structured output capabilities of modern LLMs, the system transforms the
   Markdown content into a standardized format, referred to as the *structured CV*. This ensures consistency and clarity
   in how experiences, skills, and achievements are represented.

3. **AI-Powered Tailoring — With Boundaries**: The *structured CV* and the job description are provided to the LLM.
   Using controlled prompts and structured output constraints, the model enhances and prioritizes relevant experiences
   that align with the job requirements — without hallucinating or inventing content. The focus is on intelligent
   rephrasing and emphasis, not fabrication.

4. **HTML & PDF Generation**: The tailored content is dynamically injected into an HTML template, which is then rendered
   and exported as a polished, ready-to-send PDF resume.

## 🪜 Steps to Use

1. **Install requirements**
    - Either with `pip install -r requirements`
    - Or with `uv sync`
2. **Run** `streamlit run app.py`
3. **Set up your OpenAI or Gemini API keys** (copy-paste it into the app, or create a `config.ini` file with an
   `[OPENAI]` or `[GEMINI]` section and `API_KEY` variable).
    - Note: if both Gemini and OpenAI API keys are provided, **Gemini** takes precedence since it has a free tier.
4. **Upload your base resume** (supported formats: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.docx`, `.md`).
5. **Paste the target job description** into the provided input field.
6. **Generate your tailored résumé** — the output is a professional PDF, optimized for the job and ready to send.
